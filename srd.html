	<h1>System Reference Document</h1>
	<h3>Game Structure</h3> 
<p>A referee controls and
describes the world to players who
then describe how their characters act
in the world.</p>
	
<h3>Action Roll</h3>
<p>When an action’s success is uncertain,
a player rolls 2d6 and adds the score
from the relevant ability and a point for
any relevant items. If the total is equal
or greater than the action’s Difficulty
Score (DS) it is successful.</p>
	
<h3>Difficulty Scores Guidelines</h3>
<p>Easy: 8 Moderate: 10 Hard: 12</p>
	
<h3>Dangerous Actions</h3>
<p>If an action has a risk of danger,
the difference between the roll and
Difficulty Score is the amount of
damage inflicted.<br>
Example:
As an action, a Player Character fights
a Robo Mantis with a DS of 10. The
player rolls 2d6 and adds 2 from their
Brute ability, 1 from their sword, and
1 from their shield. The total is 12.
The difference between 12 and 10 is
2, so the creature takes 2 damage.
A non player character’s DS is also
their Health Points, so now the Robo
Mantis’s Difficulty Score is 8. If the roll
was 8 then the Player Character would
have lost 2 health.</p>
	
<h3>Inventory</h3>
<p>Your Inventory Score is how many
items you can carry comfortably.
For each item that exceeds your
Inventory Score subtract 1 from any
Brute or Skulker Rolls.</p>
	
<h3>Death</h3>
<p>When a character’s Health Points reach
zero, they die.</p>
	
<h3>Advancement</h3>
<p>Level up every 2 game sessions. Each
level, raise a class score by 1 and raise
either Health or Inventory Score by 1.</p>
	
<h3>Healing</h3>
<p>Regain lost Health Points by spending
the night in a safe spot.</p>

<h3>Abilities</h3>
<p>Every player character has a score of
zero or more for these abilities
<b>Brute</b><br>
<i>Good at smacking things, feats of strength</i><br>
<b>Skulker</b><br>
<i>Good at sneaking, aiming, balancing</i><br>
<b>Erudite</b><br>
<i>Good at reading, perception, speaking</i>
</p>
