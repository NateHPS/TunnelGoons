	<h3>Game Structure</h3> 
  A referee controls and
describes the world to players who
then describe how their characters act
in the world.
<h3>Action Roll</h3>
When an action’s success is uncertain,
a player rolls 2d6 and adds the score
from the relevant ability and a point for
any relevant items. If the total is equal
or greater than the action’s Difficulty
Score (DS) it is successful.
<h3>Difficulty Scores Guidelines</h3>
Easy: 8 Moderate: 10 Hard: 12
<h3>Dangerous Actions</h3>
If an action has a risk of danger,
the difference between the roll and
Difficulty Score is the amount of
damage inflicted.
Example:
As an action, a Player Character fights
a Robo Mantis with a DS of 10. The
player rolls 2d6 and adds 2 from their
Brute ability, 1 from their sword, and
1 from their shield. The total is 12.
The difference between 12 and 10 is
2, so the creature takes 2 damage.
A non player character’s DS is also
their Health Points, so now the Robo
Mantis’s Difficulty Score is 8. If the roll
was 8 then the Player Character would
have lost 2 health.
<h3>Inventory</h3>
Your Inventory Score is how many
items you can carry comfortably.
For each item that exceeds your
Inventory Score subtract 1 from any
Brute or Skulker Rolls.
<h3>Death</h3>
When a character’s Health Points reach
zero, they die.
<h3>Advancement</h3>
Level up every 2 game sessions. Each
level, raise a class score by 1 and raise
either Health or Inventory Score by 1.
<h3>Healing</h3>
Regain lost Health Points by spending
the night in a safe spot.

<h3>Abilities</h3>
Every player character has a score of
zero or more for these abilities
Brute: Good at smacking things, feats
of strength, resisting poison.
Skulker: Good at sneaking, aiming,
balancing, dodging.
Erudite: Good at reading, perception,
speaking, remembering.
